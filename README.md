# Titan1280
Python program to run ICI Titan 1280 camera. Works on Mac, but modification of the line contianing AVFoundation and swapping for platform correct webcam interface should work on PC and Linux

Features to add: 
  full serial control of camera beyond just NUC (gain settings, calibration, etc)
  RAW 16bit time tagged TIFF recording

Based on code by Gamerpaddy. Thank you!
